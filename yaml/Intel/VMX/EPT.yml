  ShortDescription: The extended page-table mechanism
  LongDescription: |
    The extended page-table mechanism (EPT) is a feature that can be used to support the virtualization of physical
    memory. When EPT is in use, certain addresses that would normally be treated as physical addresses (and used to
    access memory) are instead treated as guest-physical addresses. Guest-physical addresses are translated by
    traversing a set of EPT paging structures to produce physical addresses that are used to access memory.

    LongDescription: |
      A 4-KByte naturally aligned EPT PML4 table is located at the physical address specified in bits 51:12 of the
      extended-page-table pointer (EPTP), a VM-execution control field. An EPT
      PML4 table comprises 512 64-bit entries (EPT PML4Es). An EPT PML4E is selected using the physical address
      defined as follows:

      - Bits 63:52 are all 0.

      - Bits 51:12 are from the EPTP.

      - Bits 11:3 are bits 47:39 of the guest-physical address.

      - Bits 2:0 are all 0.

      Because an EPT PML4E is identified using bits 47:39 of the guest-physical address, it controls access to a 512-
      GByte region of the guest-physical-address space.

    ShortDescription: EPT memory type.
    LongDescription: |
      The effective memory type of a memory access using a guest-physical address (an access that is translated
      using EPT) is the memory type that is used to access memory. The effective memory type is based on the value of
      bit 30 (cache disable—CD) in control register CR0; the last EPT paging-structure entry used to translate the guestphysical
      address (either an EPT PDE with bit 7 set to 1 or an EPT PTE); and the PAT memory type (see below):

      - The PAT memory type depends on the value of CR0.PG:

        * If CR0.PG = 0, the PAT memory type is WB (writeback).

        * If CR0.PG = 1, the PAT memory type is the memory type selected from the IA32_PAT MSR.

      - The EPT memory type is specified in bits 5:3 of the last EPT paging-structure entry: 0 = UC; 1 = WC; 4 =
        WT; 5 = WP; and 6 = WB. Other values are reserved and cause EPT misconfigurations.

      - If CR0.CD = 0, the effective memory type depends upon the value of bit 6 of the last EPT paging-structure
        entry:

        * If the value is 0, the effective memory type is the combination of the EPT memory type and the PAT
          memory type, using the EPT memory type in place of the MTRR
          memory type.

        * If the value is 1, the memory type used for the access is the EPT memory type. The PAT memory type is
          ignored.

      - If CR0.CD = 1, the effective memory type is UC.

        The MTRRs have no effect on the memory type used for an access to a guest-physical address.
