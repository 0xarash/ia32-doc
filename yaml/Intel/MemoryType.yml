- Name: MEMORY_TYPE
  ShortDescription: Memory caching type.
  LongDescription: |
    The processor allows any area of system memory to be cached in the L1, L2, and L3 caches. In individual pages or
    regions of system memory, it allows the type of caching (also called memory type) to be specified.

    ShortName: UC
    LongName: UNCACHEABLE
    ShortDescription: Strong Uncacheable (UC)
    LongDescription: |
      System memory locations are not cached. All reads and writes appear on the
      system bus and are executed in program order without reordering. No speculative memory accesses, pagetable
      walks, or prefetches of speculated branch targets are made. This type of cache-control is useful for
      memory-mapped I/O devices. When used with normal RAM, it greatly reduces processor performance.

  - Value: 1
    ShortName: WC
    LongName: WRITE_COMBINING
    ShortDescription: Write Combining (WC)
    LongDescription: |
      System memory locations are not cached (as with uncacheable memory) and
      coherency is not enforced by the processorâ€™s bus coherency protocol. Speculative reads are allowed. Writes
      may be delayed and combined in the write combining buffer (WC buffer) to reduce memory accesses. If the WC
      buffer is partially filled, the writes may be delayed until the next occurrence of a serializing event; such as, an
      SFENCE or MFENCE instruction, CPUID execution, a read or write to uncached memory, an interrupt
      occurrence, or a LOCK instruction execution. This type of cache-control is appropriate for video frame buffers,
      where the order of writes is unimportant as long as the writes update memory so they can be seen on the
      graphics display. This memory type is available in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II
      processors by programming the MTRRs; or in processor families starting from the Pentium III processors by
      programming the MTRRs or by selecting it through the PAT.

  - Value: 4
    ShortName: WT
    LongName: WRITE_THROUGH
    ShortDescription: Write-through (WT)
    LongDescription: |
      Writes and reads to and from system memory are cached. Reads come from cache
      lines on cache hits; read misses cause cache fills. Speculative reads are allowed. All writes are written to a
      cache line (when possible) and through to system memory. When writing through to memory, invalid cache
      lines are never filled, and valid cache lines are either filled or invalidated. Write combining is allowed. This type
      of cache-control is appropriate for frame buffers or when there are devices on the system bus that access
      system memory, but do not perform snooping of memory accesses. It enforces coherency between caches in
      the processors and system memory.

    ShortName: WB
    LongName: WRITE_BACK
    ShortDescription: Write protected (WP)
    LongDescription: |
      Reads come from cache lines when possible, and read misses cause cache fills.
      Writes are propagated to the system bus and cause corresponding cache lines on all processors on the bus to
      be invalidated. Speculative reads are allowed. This memory type is available in processor families starting from
      the P6 family processors by programming the MTRRs.
