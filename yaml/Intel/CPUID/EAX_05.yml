- ShortName: EAX_05
  LongName: EAX_05
  ShortDescription: MONITOR/MWAIT Leaf
  LongDescription: |
    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 05H, the processor returns information about features available to
    MONITOR/MWAIT instructions. The MONITOR instruction is used for address-range monitoring in conjunction with
    MWAIT instruction. The MWAIT instruction optionally provides additional extensions for advanced power management.
