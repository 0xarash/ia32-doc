      Name: MAX_SIZE_REQUIRED_BY_ENABLED_FEATURES_IN_XCR0
      Description: |
        Maximum size (bytes, from the beginning of the XSAVE/XRSTOR save area) required by
        enabled features in XCR0. May be different than ECX if some features at the end of the XSAVE save area
        are not enabled.

    Type: Bitfield
    Size: 32
    Fields:
    - Bit: 0-31
      Name: MAX_SIZE_OF_XSAVE_XRSTOR_SAVE_AREA
      Description: |
        Maximum size (bytes, from the beginning of the XSAVE/XRSTOR save area) of the
        XSAVE/XRSTOR save area required by all supported features in the processor, i.e., all the valid bit fields in
        XCR0.
