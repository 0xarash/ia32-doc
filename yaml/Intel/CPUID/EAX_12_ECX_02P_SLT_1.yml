  Description: Intel SGX EPC Enumeration Leaf, sub-leaves (EAX = 12H, ECX = 2 or higher).
  Note: |
    Leaf 12H sub-leaf 2 or higher (ECX >= 2) is supported if CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0H):EBX[SGX] = 1.

    This structure describes sub-leaf type 1.
  Type: Struct

    - Bit: 0-3
      Name: SUB_LEAF_TYPE
      Description: |
        Sub-leaf Type 1. This sub-leaf enumerates an EPC section. EBX:EAX and EDX:ECX provide information on the
        Enclave Page Cache (EPC) section.

    - Bit: 12-31
      Name: EPC_BASE_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_1
      Description: |
        Bits 31:12 of the physical address of the base of the EPC section.

  - Name: EBX
    Type: Bitfield
    Size: 32
    Fields:
    - Bit: 0-19
      Name: EPC_BASE_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_2
      Description: Bits 51:32 of the physical address of the base of the EPC section.

  - Name: ECX
    Type: Bitfield
    Size: 32
    Fields:
    - Bit: 0-3
      Name: EPC_SECTION_PROPERTY
      Description: |
        EPC section property encoding defined as follows:

        - If EAX[3:0] 0000b, then all bits of the EDX:ECX pair are enumerated as 0.

        - If EAX[3:0] 0001b, then this section has confidentiality and integrity protection.

        All other encodings are reserved.

    - Bit: 12-31
      Name: EPC_SIZE_1
      Description: |
        Bits 31:12 of the size of the corresponding EPC section within the Processor Reserved Memory.

  - Name: EDX
    Type: Bitfield
    Size: 32
    Fields:
    - Bit: 0-19
      Name: EPC_SIZE_2
      Description: |
        Bits 51:32 of the size of the corresponding EPC section within the Processor Reserved Memory.
