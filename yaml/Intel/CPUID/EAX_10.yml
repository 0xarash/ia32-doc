  LongName: EAX_10
  ShortDescription: EAX = 0x10
  LongDescription: |
    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 10H and ECX = 0, the processor returns information about the bit-vector
    representation of QoS Enforcement resource types that are supported in the processor. Each bit, starting from bit
    1, corresponds to a specific resource type if the bit is set. The bit position corresponds to the sub-leaf index (or
    ResID) that software must use to query QoS enforcement capability available for that type.

    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 10H and ECX = n (n >= 1, and is a valid ResID), the processor returns information
    about available classes of service and range of QoS mask MSRs that software can use to configure each
    class of services using capability bit masks in the QoS Mask registers, IA32_resourceType_Mask_n.
