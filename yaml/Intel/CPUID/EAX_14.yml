- ShortName: EAX_14
  LongName: EAX_14
  ShortDescription: EAX = 0x14
  LongDescription: |
    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 14H and ECX = 0H, the processor returns information about Intel Processor
    Trace extensions.

    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 14H and ECX = n (n > 0 and less than the number of non-zero bits in
    CPUID.(EAX=14H, ECX= 0H).EAX), the processor returns information about packet generation in Intel Processor
    Trace.
