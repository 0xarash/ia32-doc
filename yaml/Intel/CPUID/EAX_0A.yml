  ShortDescription: Architectural Performance Monitoring Leaf
  LongDescription: |
    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0AH, the processor returns information about support for architectural
    performance monitoring capabilities. Architectural performance monitoring is supported if the version ID is greater than Pn 0.
    For each version of architectural performance monitoring capability, software must enumerate this leaf to discover
    the programming facilities and the architectural performance events available in the processor.
