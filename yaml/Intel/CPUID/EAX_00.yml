  ShortDescription: Returns CPUID’s Highest Value for Basic Processor Information and the Vendor Identification String
  LongDescription: |
    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 0, the processor returns the highest value the CPUID recognizes for
    returning basic processor information. The value is returned in the EAX register and is processor specific.

    A vendor identification string is also returned in EBX, EDX, and ECX. For Intel processors, the string is “GenuineIntel”
    and is expressed:

    - EBX ← 756e6547h (* “Genu”, with G in the low eight bits of BL *)

    - EDX ← 49656e69h (* “ineI”, with i in the low eight bits of DL *)

    - ECX ← 6c65746eh (* “ntel”, with n in the low eight bits of CL *)
