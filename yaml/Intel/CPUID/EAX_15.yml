  ShortDescription: Stamp Counter and Nominal Core Crystal Clock Information Leaf
  LongDescription: |
    When CPUID executes with EAX set to 15H and ECX = 0H, the processor returns information about Time Stamp
    Counter and Core Crystal Clock.
  Note: |
    If EBX[31:0] is 0, the TSC/”core crystal clock” ratio is not enumerated.
    EBX[31:0]/EAX[31:0] indicates the ratio of the TSC frequency and the core crystal clock frequency.

    If ECX is 0, the nominal core crystal clock frequency is not enumerated.
    “TSC frequency” = “core crystal clock frequency” * EBX/EAX.
