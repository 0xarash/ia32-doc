- ShortName: EAX_18_ECX_00
  LongName: EAX_18_ECX_00
  Description: Deterministic Address Translation Parameters Main Leaf (EAX = 18H, ECX = 0).
  Note: |
    Each sub-leaf enumerates a different address translation structure.

    If ECX contains an invalid sub-leaf index, EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX return 0. Sub-leaf index n is invalid if n
    exceeds the value that sub-leaf 0 returns in EAX. A sub-leaf index is also invalid if EDX[4:0] returns 0.
    Valid sub-leaves do not need to be contiguous or in any particular order. A valid sub-leaf may be in a
    higher input ECX value than an invalid sub-leaf or than a valid sub-leaf of a higher or lower-level structure.

      Name: TRANSLATION_CACHE_TYPE_FIELD
      Description: |
        Translation cache type field.

        - 00000b: Null (indicates this sub-leaf is not valid).

        - 00001b: Data TLB.

        - 00010b: Instruction TLB.

        - 00011b: Unified TLB.

        All other encodings are reserved.
      Note: |
        Some unified TLBs will allow a single TLB entry to satisfy data read/write and instruction fetches.
        Others will require separate entries (e.g., one loaded on data read/write and another loaded on an
        instruction fetch) . Please see the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual for
        details of a particular product.
