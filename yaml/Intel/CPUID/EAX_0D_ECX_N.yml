- ShortName: EAX_0D_ECX_N
  LongName: EAX_0D_ECX_N
  Description: Processor Extended State Enumeration Sub-leaves (EAX = 0DH, ECX = n, n > 1).
  Note: |
    Leaf 0DH output depends on the initial value in ECX.
    Each sub-leaf index (starting at position 2) is supported if it corresponds to a supported bit in either the
    XCR0 register or the IA32_XSS MSR.

    If ECX contains an invalid sub-leaf index, EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX return 0. Sub-leaf n (0 ≤ n ≤ 31) is invalid
    if sub-leaf 0 returns 0 in EAX[n] and sub-leaf 1 returns 0 in ECX[n]. Sub-leaf n (32 ≤ n ≤ 63) is invalid if
    sub-leaf 0 returns 0 in EDX[n-32] and sub-leaf 1 returns 0 in EDX[n-32].

      Name: IA32_PLATFORM_DCA_CAP
      Description: |
        The size in bytes (from the offset specified in EBX) of the save area for an extended state
        feature associated with a valid sub-leaf index, n.

  - Name: EBX
    Type: Bitfield
    Size: 32
    Fields:
    - Bit: 0-31
      Name: RESERVED
      Description: |
        The offset in bytes of this extended state component’s save area from the beginning of the
        XSAVE/XRSTOR area.

        This field reports 0 if the sub-leaf index, n, does not map to a valid bit in the XCR0 register.

  - Name: ECX
    Type: Bitfield
    Size: 32
    Fields:
    - Bit: 0
      Name: ECX_2 # TODO
      Description: |
        Is set if the bit n (corresponding to the sub-leaf index) is supported in the IA32_XSS MSR; it is clear
        if bit n is instead supported in XCR0.

    - Bit: 1
      Name: ECX_1 # TODO
      Description: |
        Is set if, when the compacted format of an XSAVE area is used, this extended state component
        located on the next 64-byte boundary following the preceding state component (otherwise, it is located
        immediately following the preceding state component).

  - Name: EDX
    Type: Bitfield
    Size: 32
    Fields:
    - Bit: 0-31
      Name: RESERVED
      Description: This field reports 0 if the sub-leaf index, n, is invalid; otherwise it is reserved.
