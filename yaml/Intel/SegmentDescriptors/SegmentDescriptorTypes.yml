  LongName: CODE_AND_DATA_SEGMENT_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE
  ShortDescription: Code- and Data-Segment Descriptor Types
  LongDescription: |
    When the S (descriptor type) flag in a segment descriptor is set, the descriptor is for either a code or a data
    segment. The highest order bit of the type field (bit 11 of the second double word of the segment descriptor) then
    determines whether the descriptor is for a data segment (clear) or a code segment (set).
    For data segments, the three low-order bits of the type field (bits 8, 9, and 10) are interpreted as accessed (A),
    write-enable (W), and expansion-direction (E). See Table 3-1 for a description of the encoding of the bits in the
    type field for code and data segments. Data segments can be read-only or read/write segments, depending on the
    setting of the write-enable bit.

  LongName: SYSTEM_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE
  ShortDescription: System Descriptor Types
  LongDescription: |
    When the S (descriptor type) flag in a segment descriptor is clear, the descriptor type is a system descriptor. The
    processor recognizes the following types of system descriptors:

    - Local descriptor-table (LDT) segment descriptor.

    - Task-state segment (TSS) descriptor.

    - Call-gate descriptor.

    - Interrupt-gate descriptor.

    - Trap-gate descriptor.

    - Task-gate descriptor.

    These descriptor types fall into two categories: system-segment descriptors and gate descriptors. Systemsegment
    descriptors point to system segments (LDT and TSS segments). Gate descriptors are in themselves
    “gates,” which hold pointers to procedure entry points in code segments (call, interrupt, and trap gates) or which
    hold segment selectors for TSS’s (task gates).
